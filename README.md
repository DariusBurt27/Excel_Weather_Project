# Excel_Weather_Project
 For this project I used Excel to make a dashboard for data on Seattle Weather. The dataset looks like this:

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdiehhajian/seattle-weather).


In order to make the line graphs in the dashboard I needed to aggregate the data through multiple pivot tables. The first one shows how the average temperature in Seattle changes by month:

The next pivot table shows how the precipitation varies by month:

The final pivot table shows how the average temperature per year has changed over time:
